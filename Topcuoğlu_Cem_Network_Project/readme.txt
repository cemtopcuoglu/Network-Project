********************************************SERVER Step 1*******************************************
In order to start listening for connections, server needs to be provided with one piece of input:
 - Port number to listen
Main functionalities of the server are as follows:
 - Server can 'start' listening for incoming connections, given the above-mentioned input
 - Server can 'stop' listening to the port it has bound to.
 - Server can 'send' and receive messages to/from clients.
Notes:
 - A connection log is provided in the rich text box of the interface, in order to keep track of
	the state of the connection, and to see what the error is when an attempt fails.
 - Abruptly closing the application does not cause any problems. It simply releases all the current
	resources and shuts down the window.
 - 'Stopping' a server acts the same as abruptly closing the application. It does not provide the
	functionality of re-initiating a listening session from any other port.
 
 ********************************************CLIENT Step 1*******************************************
In order to initiate a connection, client needs to be provided with three pieces of input:
 - IP number of the server
 - Port number of the server
 - A unique username
Main functionalities of the client are as follows:
 - Client can 'connect' to a server, given the above-mentioned input.
 - Client can 'disconnect' from the server any time.
 - Client can request a 'lobby list', i.e., the list of online players connected to the same server
	at any time.
 - Client can 'send' and receive messages to/from the server.
Notes:
 - Connection must be initiated with a unique username.
 - A disconnected client can connect any other server providing the necessary input.
 - A connection log is provided in the rich text box of the interface, in order to keep track of
	the state of the connection, and to	see what the error is when an attempt fails.
 - Abruptly closing the application does not cause any problems. It simply disconnects the client
	from the server as usual while the interface is being closed.
